Welcome to Museum Wiki project by the team lafayette53.
Museum Wiki is Wikipedia-like site that hosts museums and artifacts. Anyone can create a museum and become the curator who is responsible for that museum. Any registered user can add and edit information about artifacts and collections in a museum, but only changes approved by the curator will be published.
